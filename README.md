# Chest-X-Ray-Effusion-Detection-using-CNN-ResNet
In this X-ray classification assignment, we built a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into "nofinding" and "effusion" classes. We tackled challenges like data augmentation, imbalanced classes, and used weighted cross-entropy to improve model performance. The goal was to identify abnormalities with high accuracy.
